When inserting 100,000 strings into the InsertRandomSpeedTest, the ULLMap is unable to even run it, while the MyAMap and TreeMap
are relatively the same speed. However, when inserting 100,000 strings into the InsertOrderSpeedTest, both the ULLMap and BSTMap
are unable to run, while the TreeMap is stll very quick, and the HashMap is close to 0.
