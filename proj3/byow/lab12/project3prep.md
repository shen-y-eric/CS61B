# Project 3 Prep

**For tessellating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way.
After looking at your own implementation, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab.
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?**

Answer:

We didn't have enough time to really implement anything, and it was definitely going to be a lot simpler than the staff solution.

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of tessellating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways?
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?**

Answer:

The hallways are the tessellations that connect the rooms.

**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tessellating hexagons.**

Answer:

I would start with an addColumns method, as well as a tiles class to create the base of the project.

**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

Answer:
Hallways and rooms are both enclosed spaces, but hallways only allow movement in one direction and connect rooms together.
